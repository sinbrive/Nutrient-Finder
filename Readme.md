# Nurient Finder

I had a project of making an app giving foods nutrients like Cronometer.

And I had alsow to try with PWA concept that I have never used before.

This work is then a try and it is incomplete for sure. I intend to improve the content in the future.

It is the first time I use IA for the first version (see ia-original directory)
